"""02 - Cartesian action chunks (receding-horizon planner style).

A receding-horizon planner emits a short chunk of Cartesian waypoints

    u = ((x, y, z, w, n), ...)            # w = gripper in [0, 1], n = #frames

and runs receding-horizon: it executes only the FIRST segment, observes, then
replans. This example shows exactly that loop against the fake backend.

    python examples/02_cartesian_chunk.py

The key call is ``robot.execute_cartesian_chunk(chunk)`` which:
  * expands the chunk to per-tick setpoints at ``control_hz`` (SLERP on
    orientation, gripper latched on the first tick of a segment),
  * time-stretches any segment that would exceed the safety profile's velocity
    limit (so it still reaches the waypoint, just no faster than allowed),
  * runs every setpoint through the safety filter, and
  * returns an :class:`ExecutionResult` with tracking error, peak speed/wrench,
    whether anything was clipped, and a stop reason -- the exact signal a planner
    logs under its "execution" failure category.
