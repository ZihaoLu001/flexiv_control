"""Core data types shared across the whole stack.

Conventions
-----------
* All quaternions are stored ``(w, x, y, z)`` -- the same order Flexiv RDK uses
  for TCP pose (``[x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz]``). Keeping one convention end to
  end avoids a whole class of silent sign/order bugs.
* SI units everywhere: metres, radians, seconds, Newtons, Newton-metres.
* Frames are named strings ("base", "tcp", "flange", "world"). The default is
  the robot base frame.

These are deliberately plain ``dataclasses`` with ``numpy`` arrays so they can
be (a) trivially serialised for the network server, (b) used from a notebook,
RL trainer, or MPC loop without dragging in ROS, and (c) type-checked.

    binary open/close; the 0/1 you see in learning benchmarks is a normalized
    *abstraction* on top of this continuous width. ``grasp=True`` selects
    move-until-contact force control (RDK ``Gripper.Grasp(force)``) instead of a
    position move.

    .. warning:: When ``grasp=True``, the RDK backend calls ``Gripper.Grasp(force)``
       and **ignores** ``width`` entirely -- the fingers close until contact at the
       force limit, and on a MISS (no object between the fingers) they slam fully
       shut to ~0.000 m. A position-actuator MuJoCo gate that drives to a finite
       close width cannot reproduce that air-close, so a mis-positioned grasp can
       pass validation in sim yet collapse to an empty grip on hardware (an
       invisible failure). For a KNOWN-SIZE object, prefer a force-limited
       ``Gripper.Move(close_width, velocity, force)`` -- set ``grasp=False`` with
       ``width`` = the just-touch width: it stalls on the object on contact but
       FLOORS at ``close_width`` on a miss, so the settled width stays non-zero and
       a "closed on air" failure is detectable. Reserve ``grasp=True`` for blind
       closes on unknown-size objects. (The MuJoCo backend mirrors the blind close;
       both drive the fingers closed and let contact stop them.)
