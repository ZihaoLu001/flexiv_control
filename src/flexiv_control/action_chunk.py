"""The unified *action contract*.

This is the single most important module for cross-project reuse. Every high
level component -- a receding-horizon planner, an MPC loop, an RL policy, a
SpaceMouse teleop bridge -- emits one of these objects, and every backend knows
how to execute them. Nobody re-invents "how do I talk to the robot".

Why this exact shape
--------------------
Action-chunking and receding-horizon planners typically emit a candidate action
of the form

    u = ( (x_j, y_j, z_j, w_j, n_j) )_{j=1..H}

i.e. a short sequence of Cartesian waypoints, each with a gripper command ``w_j``
and a *number of low-level control frames* ``n_j``. That ``n_j`` is precisely a
duration once you fix a control rate:

    duration_j = n_frames_j / control_hz

``CartesianChunk`` below is that object, generalised so it is also exactly what
an MPC horizon, a robosuite/MuJoCo rollout, or an RL action-chunk needs:
  * positions become full SE(3) poses (orientation may be *held* -> position-only
    chunks map in with zero changes),
  * per-waypoint stiffness/limits so the *same* chunk can describe a free-space
    reach and a contact-rich push,
  * an explicit ``representation`` (absolute vs relative-to-chunk-start) and a
    predict-vs-execute horizon split (``n_execute`` -> ``horizon_exec``), so the
    receding-horizon "predict H_pred, execute H_exec, replan" loop (Diffusion
    Policy Tp/Ta) is first-class rather than implicit,
  * an explicit safety_profile name so execution is reproducible.
